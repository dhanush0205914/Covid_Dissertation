According to the author of the PCR test, Nobel laureate Kari Mulis (video below), it is not a test for Covid but a generic test for general respiratory problems, which can be adjusted by determining the various numbers of the test cycle.

A third vaccine re-activates the immune system, which triggers the immune system to create an explosive course of the disease.
